## 42.010. Rotary Fellowships

### 42.010.1. Terms of Fellowships

A Rotary fellowship is a group of individuals that globally unites around a common interest, vocation, or recreational activity with the primary purpose to network, further friendship, and build community. Membership in a fellowship is open to any interested individual. Fellowships should be inclusive to participants from all backgrounds regardless of their age, ethnicity, race, color, abilities, religion, socioeconomic status, culture, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

Fellowship activities must be conducted independently of RI, but must be in harmony with RI policy, including the use of the Rotary Marks. Fellowships may not be used to promote religious beliefs, political issues, or other organizations.

Recognition of a fellowship by RI in no way implies legal, financial or other obligation or responsibility on the part of RI, or any district or club. A fellowship may not act on behalf of RI, or represent or imply that it has authority to act on behalf of RI. A fellowship is not an agency of RI. Fellowships must be self-sustaining financially, administratively, and otherwise. Fellowships may not exist or function in any country in violation of the laws of such country.

Individual Rotary Fellowships are not covered by RI insurance and are encouraged to assess their own risk and secure coverage as appropriate. (November 2021 Mtg., Bd. Dec. 52)
